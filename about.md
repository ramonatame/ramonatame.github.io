	<h1 class="pageTitle">About</h1>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>This website contains tutorials, guides and step-by-step instructions on improving the security posture of an organisation and other articles useful for blue-hat professionals. It follows a defensive perspective and explains topics that are less commonly discussed or agreed upon on the Internet or to provide yet another view on the subject. </p>
	<h2>How did this website start</h2>
	<p>The author's interest in achieving the best security state an organisation can afford within a specific budget led her to various in-depth questions. She soon realised there is not as much practical information on blue-hat security as it is on red-hat. There is some basic knowledge, such as baselines and tools. But there are quite few practical guides there on tailoring the tools, baselines and tailoring the security design as to an organisation's custom needs. Hence, this website was created to help other professionals by filling in the gaps found on defensive security shared knowledge. </p>
	<h2>Who is this website for</h2>
	<p>This website is designed especially for security professionals working as part of blue teams, but it can be useful to any security-focused professionals alike, due to understanding of the way defensive security may be implemented within organisations. </p>
	<h2>Who is the author</h2>
