We've all been at that point in our career - when we feel we haven't progressed much over some time in our current job, especially if we think we invest quite a bit of personal time for our career development. That was my case, a few months back this year. And although I liked the team and enjoyed working there, I decided it's time to move on. I learned a few lessons along the way, so here they are. Hopefully you'll find them useful, too!

## 1. Start with a discussion with external HR consultants.

You know your skills, you know your goals. What you don't know is the market and this is an important part of the equation. Even if in theory a specific set of skills should get you to your goals, in practice they depend on the market needs and how skilled those you're competing with are. You may think you understand the market, but truth to be told, chances are you can't beat the external HR/ Talent Recruiters consultants, and that is because they have the data. They hire continuously for the roles you're interested in, so they know the market requirements and what it takes for a candidate to succeed.
So once you thought well about your goals, initiate discussions with external recruiters. You may be surprised they are open to give you insights and to assess whether your goals are realistic even. In retrospective, it's one of the best steps I had in my hiring strategy.

## 2. Ask to discuss with the hiring manager first.

You may find that many companies ask you to go through all the interviews, soft-skills and technical, before you actually have a discussion with the hiring manager. Here is a lesson I learned the hard way: the only person who really knows what they hire for and the day to day responsibilities you'd have, is the hiring manager. Interviewing takes time, so it only makes sense to discuss first whether the job is what you're looking for. Just because the job specs seem a good fit, it doesn't mean that's exactly what you're going to do. Job specs are often generic and even outdated.

## 3. Ask details about the interviewing process before you even start it.

Some companies may not have a well-defined interviewing process or they have a cumbersome one. Before you start interviewing, ask them as many details they can give you on the interviewing itself, such as topics you may need to brush on, where about in the process the other candidates are, what difficulties other candidates find in securing that job, how many interviewing stages they have. As long as you ask politely, it won't hurt your chances to ask. Most companies have 3-4 interview rounds for security roles here in UK, but just because I omitted to ask how many interview rounds, I still got in the situation of going through 8 interview rounds before I got the offer at one of the companies.

## 4. Negociations can be hard. If you feel it doesn't worth it, then it's not.

There was this big well-known corporation where I enjoyed so much going through all the technical interviews! Each felt rather a discussion with smart and nice people in the industry, which I would have definitely liked to work with. This decision was particularly difficult as the experience I had with the Talent Recruiter was miserable. He wasn't prompt in scheduling my interviews, then he let me know I passed the interviews but we will discuss the offer in 2 weeks, when he gets back from holiday. Work-life balance matters for me, too, but I couldn't understand why I wasn't passed on to one of his colleagues in the meantime. After he got back from holiday, he sent me the job offer, where they substituted a significant part of the initially discussed base salary with company shares. Someone very smart taught me to always negociate the base salary above everything else. 
So negociations started. They were particularly hard with this company, as most of their arguments were borderline aggressive and the rest were based on gains I would get due to the company's reputation rather than tangible benefits. That was what I considered my dream job at my dream company and still I'm so glad I turned them down. Respect is important, in all its shapes.

## 5. Interview the company.

This is merely a follow-up for the previous points. Always interview the company while they interview you. You can never know exactly how it is going to be before you start working there, but those hours you spend on interviewing still give you some indications. That's how I decided not to accept the offer from the hedgefund - turns out, those 8 interview stages gave me enough time to see some red flags and decide not to accept the offer, even if definitely a good one. And that's how I decided not to follow through with what was my dream corporation: negociations should stay respectful and professional.

## 6. Interview for two steps further in your career.

Although time consuming, interviewing first for two steps further in my career gave me a reasonable idea of how to get there. It was the best opportunity I found to discuss with people who are where I want to be. I am really grateful to them as they were happy to also share a few of their career advices.

## 7. Titles matter. Specifications don't.

Many argue that titles don't matter, but as I tested interviewing for two steps further in my career, even though I passed all the technical interviews, I was told repeatedly that I need first a promotion (the title) for the job I was looking for, as that job is rarely one that you secure first while looking outside your company. So some jobs require you to get promoted internally in order to switch to the new role. Unfortunately, most companies are not flexible in the titles and levels they offer. Hence, asking for career growth opportunities when interviewing made it on my list.
At the other end, job specifications don't matter. As mentioned before, they are often generic or outdated and the only way to know for sure if the job is what you're looking for is to discuss with the hiring manager.

## 8. Before searching for a job, ask your manager for the changes you're looking for.

A manager told me once that it's very difficult to hire people, hence whenever I wanted to leave, to let him know first and he'll do his best to accomodate my needs. He was one of the best managers I had. He was assigned to a different team after some time, so technically I never left him.
I followed his advice further in my career path and I found that generally managers are open for discussions, but most of them fail to follow through with their promises (yes, you usually negociate promises at this point). More importantly, for some reason even if you choose to stay, communications with most of those managers deteriorate effective immediately. There are exceptions, so be wise.

## 9. Contact internal HR directly.

It is the case especially for corporations (but not only), which have their own internal recruitement teams, rather then using external consultants. Sometimes you can find what looks like your dream job - great specs, great company, and still be unable to get in touch with them or get contacted back. It may be that they use a referal system and you don't know anybody there to refer you. In situations like this, it seems effective to just contact one or more internal recruiters and start from there. You may still not get an answer, that's true and reasonable, but you may as well increase your chances of them getting back to you. Don't abuse it though. Put yourself in their shoes first.

## 10. Finding a job is easy. Finding the right job takes time.

Unless you're conditioned to find a job immediately, there is no need to rush looking for a new job. Breaks are acceptable, too. Don't be put off by the fact that it takes a longer time to find a job compared with the time when you were at the beginning of your career and you were willing to accept anything. The more you progress in your career, the better you define a job on your terms, that takes you closer to your goals. In this process, you'll cut out many of the jobs you could get but don't align anymore with your goals or expectations. Chances are you get contacted a lot for new jobs. However, finding the right job takes time.

## Summing up

I was in doubt whether to post an article on this topic, but as my blogging "mantra" is to post anything security related that I wish I would have found online, here they are. The 10 lessons I learned while looking for my next security role in UK. Hopefully you found something that will help you, too, in your next career search!
